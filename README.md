* Communicating when the FOSS@MAGIC meetings are
* How to become involved with the group
* Platforms / tools for communicating with the group
* Resources / benefits to members

This website, the [fossr.it](http://fossr.it) domain, and the deployed instance are managed by students and not officially associated with the RIT FOSS@MAGIC program.
