FOSS@MAGIC is the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) program at the [RIT MAGIC Center](https://magic.rit.edu/).
Founded in 2009, it is an initiative created to help develop and support FOSS efforts at RIT.
A leader in academia for open source education, the program has created the [first-ever minor](https://www.rit.edu/study/curriculum/e4af015b-d2bf-4a7e-9a48-08c7d25dc4d1 "Free and Open Source Software and Free Culture Minor - Curriculum") in Free and Open Source Software in the country and supports students with finding co-ops and jobs in the industry.

The initiative is active and engaged with the open source community at large.
It is sponsored since 2010 by [Red Hat, Inc](https://www.redhat.com/).
Through its [LibreCorps initiative](/librecorps), students contribute to projects and do internships on humanitarian, community and educational efforts with:

Our students represent us at community tables at [OSCON](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/) and [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/).
They have presented posters and bird-of-a-feather sessions there.
