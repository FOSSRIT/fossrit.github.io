FOSS@MAGIC is the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) program at the [RIT MAGIC Center](https://magic.rit.edu/).
Founded in 2009, it is an initiative created to help develop and support FOSS efforts at RIT.
A leader in academia for open source education, the program has created the [first-ever minor](https://www.rit.edu/gccis/igm/sites/rit.edu.gccis.igm/files/images/FOSS-MN%20Semesters.pdf "FOSS-MN - overview") in Free and Open Source Software in the country and supports students with finding co-ops and jobs in the industry.
The initiative is active and engaged with the open source community at large, helping bring in renowned speakers and regional conferences to the RIT community while supporting local efforts in the Rochester area.
Today, it continues to expand education in FOSS and foster collaborations with other universities and initiatives.
