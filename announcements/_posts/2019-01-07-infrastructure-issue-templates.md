Today, the [FOSSRIT/infrastructure](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/infrastructure) repository now has ticket templates to help the FOSS@MAGIC community with infrastructure needs.
There are four types of tickets to open:

1. **Service disruption**: Something is offline or not working
2. **Infrastructure request**: Request a new web app or computing resources for projects
3. **General enhancement / improvement**: Could something be better? Tell us how.
4. **Other**: Anything that doesn't belong in previous categories

If you need help, want to request a new web app, or think something could be better with FOSSRIT infrastructure, let us know!
The repository is monitored by FOSS@MAGIC student employees and other community members.
If you have questions or have other thoughts, say hello in our [IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rit-foss) or [Telegram group](https://t.me/fossrit).


Cheers,
