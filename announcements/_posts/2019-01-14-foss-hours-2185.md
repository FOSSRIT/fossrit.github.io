Hi FOSS fans!
FOSS Hours are back for the Spring 2019 semester on **Wednesdays from 5:00pm until 7:00pm**.
Note the date change for this semester.
Find us in the new MAGIC Spell Studios building in MSS-3190 (second floor conference room).


## What are FOSS Hours?

Want to meet other students, faculty, and staff interested in free and open source software at RIT?
FOSS Hours is an informal time for the FOSS community at RIT to gather.
Come to see what other people are working on, share what things you're working on, or take some time to get caught up on homework or other project work.
You can stay for as short or for as long as you like.
No RSVP is necessary.

We hope to see you on Wednesday nights, whether it's your hundredth time or your first time!


Cheers,

â€” Justin W. Flory (jwf / jflory7)
