Over the past several years, there has been a greater willingness within the game industry to use open source technologies and/or put their own proprietary tech under a wide variety of fully or semi-open licenses.
There are also more independents working with open game engines like Godot.

This past fall, the [Academy for Motion Picture Arts and Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences) joined forces with the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) to create the [Academy Software Foundation](https://www.aswf.io/) to "provide a 'neutral' space for artists, engineers and developers to share work and collaborate on projects, thereby increasing both the quality and quantity of open source tools."
The companies currently signed on are, by a wide majority, film industry companies.
There are a few game industry companies currently engaged and the language on the website alludes to this foundation covering multimedia and games as well.

The goal of this IGDA GDC roundtable is to to learn more about the ASWF and its mission and to ask questions like the following:

1. What are the up and downsides of such an effort?
2. Considering there is an overlap, but not an overall match, between the needs of game production and film and television production, should games be a part of this effort or should there be a separate foundation?
3. What might next steps be in seeing this model, or another, move forward to promote the benefits of open source to and/or within the game industry?


## Who will be there?

The session will be led by [Stephen Jacobs](https://www.rit.edu/gccis/stephen-jacobs) of the [FOSS@MAGIC initiative](https://fossrit.github.io/) and a Professor in the School of Interactive Games and Media at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
Joining the roundtable are [Chris Aniszczyk](https://twitter.com/cra) of the Linux Foundation, [Ruth Suehle](https://twitter.com/suehle) of Red Hat, Inc. and [Todd Prives](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddprives/), of the Academy Software Foundation Board.

The roundtable will be held at GDC in the Moscone Center Hall on March 20th at 9:00 AM.
You must be an attendee of the Game Developer's Conference with at least an "Expo Pass" to attend the roundtable.
