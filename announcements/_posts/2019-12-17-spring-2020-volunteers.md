Hi FOSS folks!
We are looking for volunteers from the RIT community!
If you are interested in volunteering with FOSS@MAGIC in the Spring 2020 semester (and at your option, beyond), please fill out this form:

[**FOSS@MAGIC Spring 2020 volunteer sign-up**](https://forms.gle/iT62o4ZiVFM8oAB66)


## Why volunteer with FOSS@MAGIC?

Volunteering with FOSS@MAGIC is a great way to become more engaged with the open source community at RIT and Rochester.
Here are some of the benefits of volunteering with FOSS@MAGIC:

* Get experience working on collaborative projects
* Learn new skills and improve existing ones you can apply to your career and resume
* Find creative ways to collaborate between FOSS and other places/clubs you are interested in
* For hands-on projects, financial assistance for project supplies is available
* Mentor others in getting involved with FOSS@MAGIC and open source activities at RIT

Volunteering will also give you a deeper look into what FOSS@MAGIC does and some of the key areas we are focusing on.
Also, **anyone involved at RIT is eligible to volunteer**!
Students, faculty, staff, and friends of FOSS@RIT are all encouraged to fill out the volunteer sign-up form if interested.


## Volunteering opportunities

There are a few different areas we are looking to focus on in 2020:

* **Community building / engagement**: People-oriented tasks, like [event planning](/events/)
* **LibreCorps**: [_See website_](/librecorps/)
* **Projects for Imagine 2020**: Hands-on projects with a presentation for exhibition booths at community events (e.g. Maker Faire and Imagine RIT)
* **RIT community outreach**: Connect with other organizations (e.g. clubs) to connect more people at RIT with FOSS
* **Tech Team**: Infrastructure management and administration, some software development, and early access to FOSS@MAGIC technology experiments

If any of these areas sound interesting and you can spend an hour or more a week to help, consider filling out the form!
