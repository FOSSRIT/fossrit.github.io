Hey FOSS folks.
Quarantine got you down?
In proper open source spirit, FOSS@MAGIC will host **virtual FOSS Hours** every Thursday, from 5pm - 6pm on [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org).
Our first virtual FOSS Hours will take place on Thursday, 26 March 2020.


## About Jitsi Meet

To pull straight from the [Jitsi website](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/):

> More secure, more flexible, and completely free video conferencing.
>
> Go ahead, video chat with the whole team.
> In fact, invite everyone you know.
> Jitsi Meet is a fully encrypted, 100% open source video conferencing solution that you can use all day, every day, for free — with no account needed.
>
> What else can you do with Jitsi Meet?
>
> * Share your desktop, presentations, and more
> * Invite users to a conference via a simple, custom URL
> * Pick fun meeting URLs for every meeting
> * Trade messages and emojis while you video conference, with integrated chat.

FOSS@MAGIC staff will host and moderate a Jitsi Meet room every Thursday for the RIT open source community to gather and say hello.
We encourage all to come and say hello as we get used to this new reality!
