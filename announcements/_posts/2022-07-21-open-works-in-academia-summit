## Attendee registration

Registration is now open.
The goal of this event is to foster conversations across different areas of specialization and, as a result, we are limiting the registration to 100 attendees.
There’s been significant initial interest in this event since our first announcement and we expect to sell out quickly.
This is planned as an in-person event, COVID-willing, but we’ll move to virtual if we must.
