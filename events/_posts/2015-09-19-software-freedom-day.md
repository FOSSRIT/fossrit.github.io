Each year, Software Freedom Day (SFD) events are organized by volunteers in dozens of cities worldwide.
These events each take on their own character, but typically involve some sort of address from the organizers, demos and presentations from community members, and installfests and hackathons.
Each venue and organizer will have their own agenda and timeline, and there were specific things that Fedora pitched to local attendees at a number of events this year.

You can read more about the competitions and activities that attendees participated in here on the [SoftwareFreedomDay page on the Fedora Wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Softwarefreedomday/2015).
