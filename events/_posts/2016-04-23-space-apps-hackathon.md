> RIT was one of over [200 participating locations](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/rochester-ny-usa) all over the world in the challenge.
>
> The NASA Space Apps Challenge is a 48-hour global hackathon engaging thousands of problem solvers each year across the globe to work with NASA in designing creative solutions to international and interplanetary problems using open source data.
The event is not just for coders, but for makers, designers, students, engineers, artists, and problem solvers of all types.
>
> In 2016, there were 25 challenges spread across six different themes:
>
> * Earth
> * Space Station
> * Solar System
> * Technology
> * Aeronautics
> * Journey to Mars
>
> Within these themes, challenges were broken out by difficulty and range from easy to advanced.

> "RIT is proud to, once again, host the Rochester location for the 2016 NASA Space Apps Challenge," said [Dan Schneiderman](http://schneidy.com/), FOSS@MAGIC Research Associate and Community Liaison.
> "We're lucky to have such incredible partners both on and off campus to bring this challenge back to RIT.
> With all of the students and faculty working on projects to help out the local and global communities, we're truly a campus that aims for the stars."
