<!-- Meetings are open to anyone interested, new members and old.
RITlug meets on every {{ site.meeting-day }}, {{ site.meeting-time }} in {{ site.meeting-place }}.
If you can't make the whole time, that's fine!
Meetings typically have a presentation first, then we open the floor to discussion and technical help.
We also hold "Project Collaboration" sessions where you can come and work on projects, homework, or just hang out.
**_Interested? Just show up!_**

Looking for more information? Email us at {{ site.email }}.
