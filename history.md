## One Laptop Per Child

One Laptop Per Child ([OLPC](https://laptop.org/)) was proposed by MIT in 2005 to [fight the gap](https://laptop.org/aboutolpc/) in access to technology in education for underprivileged children.

Stephen Jacobs, director of RIT's Lab for Technological Literacy (LTL) at the time, was interested in the program and acquired three OLPC XO 1.0 laptops in 2007 via the first "Give One, Get One" program. 
In January 2009, Rochester Institute of Technology had an honors class that developed educational games for the OLPC program. That was the earliest documented birth of Open-Source @ RIT. 
Open-source advocates, such as Karlie Robinson and David Nalley, were brought in by Professor Jacobs to support the class. 
Karlie Robinson introduced the students to the Sugar Labs' Math 4 initiative which was dedicated to supporting 4th grade curricula. 
David Nalley, who was part of the [Fedora community](https://fedoraproject.org), donated 25 XO laptops to help students contribute to the Sugar initiative.
This ended the first iteration of the class, but the seminar class went on for several more iterations, with more incredible open-source advocates joining the picture.
Sadly, the original history was based on an old [magic.rit.edu](https://web.archive.org/web/20150427134219/http://magic.rit.edu/foss/history.html) page, now it no longer exists.



## FOSSBOX:

Estimated to have started in 2010, Stephen Jacobs hired Remy DeCausemaker (RIT alumni) to run the open-source program. Remy was initially from the Red Hat Corporation so the club had a great foundation.
Initially, it was set up as a semi-student club, but more of an informal student group called the Free and Open-Source Software Box (FOSSBOX). It served as a 24-hour access space that was housed in the innovation center (also known as Fish Bowl). FOSSBOX used an IRC channel on Freenode to communicate when not in the designated space.
As the first group to introduce hackathons to the student population, FOSSBOX's impact on RIT's culture continues as several hackathons are run every semester.
FOSSBOX also ran several of their hackathons when they were active, such as [Election Night Hackathon](https://fossrit.github.io/events/2019/11/05/election-night-hackathon/) and Random Hacks of Kindness, as well as several others.
The original Humanitarian Free and Open-Source Software (HFOSS) seminar class was accredited and students in that class commonly got introduced and involved in the student group as well.
Remy and FOSSBOX started the [course-to-coop life cycle](https://opensource.com/education/10/3/course-co-op-lifecycle-openinnovationrit) where students in open-source would receive co-op offers from companies that were funding and interested in open-source at RIT. This cycle repeated as those students graduated and got full-time offers and referred those who were in the student club for co-op positions.
FOSSBOX may have been an informal student group at first but it grew to the point where a full-time staff member was managing FOSSBOX and undergraduate students had part-time paid roles doing the secretarial work for FOSSBOX, both of which were funded by a yearly payment by Red Hat Corporation.
The FOSSBOX community operated for 9 years, collaborating with organizations in the local area such as [Hacks/Hackers](https://www.hackshackers.com/), [BarCampROC](https://rocwiki.org/BarCamp_Rochester), and the student club [CodeRIT](https://github.com/codeRIT).



## LibreCorps:

Founded in 2012, LibreCorps' first purpose was as a co-op program after developing educational games under the 'One Laptop Per Child' program.
LibreCorps serves as an experiential learning program where students are deployed to work on real-world open-source software and data projects, supporting faculty partners with direct software development as well as community management, documentation, design, and other forms of non-code contribution.
RIT LibreCorps has been partnered intermittently with the UNICEF Office of Innovation since 2014.
As a successful pilot, LibreCorps reached up to 24 supported faculty-driven software projects!



## FOSS Minor

Beginning of the Fall 2014 Semester, Rochester Institute of Technology started to offer the first minor in [Free and Open Source Software and Free Culture](https://www.rit.edu/study/free-and-open-source-software-and-free-culture-minor).
The minor was brought about by additional courses offered by the School of Interactive Games and Media ([IGM](https://www.rit.edu/computing/school-interactive-games-and-media)).



## FOSS@RIT:

FOSS@RIT is the name of the GitHub organization for all things open-source at Rochester Institute of Technology, however, the organization isn't very official. 
During the period of renaming from FOSSBOX to FOSS@MAGIC, this was what you would call the Open-Source hub, though interchangeable with the FOSS@MAGIC name.
The FOSS@RIT community was full of people with an interest in free and open-source software at RIT. At the time, FOSS@RIT had the initial purpose of keeping FOSSBOX alive.



## FOSS@MAGIC:

When [Magic Spell Studio](https://www.rit.edu/magic/magic-spell-studios) was conceptualized, this organization was established to prioritize game development, which was where open-source got started on this campus.
This organization was managed by [Andrew Phelps](https://professorandrewphelps.net/) in 2015. Since the magic building was not completed at the time, they were relocated to the innovation center, in the exact location that FOSSBOX initially used. 
FOSS Hours were introduced, which helped increase the involvement of students and other interested parties. However, shortly after, Remy DeCausemaker left Rochester Institute of Technology to go work for Twitter, which made the open-source community lose its growing momentum.
The organization still had funding and students were still getting involved, events were being run and the organization finally was relocated to inside Magic Spell Studio, which was newly constructed. FOSS@Magic existed in this manner for quite a while, but things changed once Stephen Jacobs got conversations started with UNICEF Innovation, a Tech R&D department permanently part of the United Nations System.



## OPEN@RIT:

In 2020, the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/) provided [financial support](https://sloan.org/grant-detail/10076) for an [open work](https://openworkdefinition.com/) organization led by the Rochester Institute of Technologyâ€™s Stephen Jacobs: [Open@RIT](https://openr.it/about/). 
This program was situated just under Rochester Institute of Technologies Vice President for Research, [Ryne Raffaelle](https://www.rit.edu/directory/rprsps-ryne-raffaelle) and has been the home of open-source at RIT for the last four years. 
The program now participates in research projects, receives funding from grants, provides other organizations open source consultation, and hosts town halls for the open-source community on campus. 
Although the name has changed to OPEN@RIT, the organization is still involved with faculty members of Magic.
