In this file, I will be planning and writing down what I currently know 
of the history.

## One Laptop Per Child
For a quick summary of what One Laptop Per Child ([OLPC](https://laptop.org/)) was proposed to accomplish: One Laptop Per Child was proposed by MIT in 2005 to [fight the gap](https://laptop.org/aboutolpc/) in access to technology in education for underprivileged children.

Stephen Jacobs, director of RIT's Lab for Technological Literacy (LTL) at the time, was interested in the program and acquired three OLPC XO 1.0 laptops in 2007 via the first "Give One, Get One" program. 
In January 2009, Rochester Institute of Technology had an honors class that developed educational games for the OLPC program. That was the earliest documented birth of Open Source @ RIT. 
Open-source advocates, such as Karlie Robinson and David Nalley, were brought in by Professor Jacobs to support the class. 
Karlie Robinson showed the students about the Sugar Labs' Math 4 initiative which was dedicated to supporting 4th grade curricula. 
David Nalley, who was part of the Fedora community, donated 25 XO laptops to help students contribute to the Sugar initiative.
This ended the first iteration of the class, but the seminar class when on for several more iterations, with more incredible open-source advocates joining the picture.
Sadly, the original history was based on an old [magic.rit.edu](https://web.archive.org/web/20150427134219/http://magic.rit.edu/foss/history.html)page, now it no longer exists.


## FOSSBOX: 
    • ~2012


## LibreCorps:
Founded in 2012, LibreCorps first purpose was as a co-op program after developing educational games once the 'One Laptop Per Child' program.
LibreCorps served as an experiential learning program where students are deployed to work on real world open source software and data projects, supporting faculty partners with direct software development as well as community management, documentation, design, and other forms of non-code contribution.
RIT LibreCorps has been partnered intermittently with the UNICEF Office of Innovation since 2014.
In 2020, the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/) provided [support](https://sloan.org/grant-detail/10076) for an effort led by the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Stephen Jacobs to design and launch an undergraduate-anchored program: [LibreCorps](https://fossrit.github.io/librecorps/). 
As a successful pilot, LibreCorps reached up to 24 supported faculty-driven software projects!


## FOSS Minor
Beginning of Fall 2014 Semester, Rochester Institute of Technology started to offer the first minor in [Free and Open Source Software and Free Culture](https://www.rit.edu/study/free-and-open-source-software-and-free-culture-minor).
The minor was brought about by additional courses offered by the School of Interactive Games and Media ([IGM](https://www.rit.edu/computing/school-interactive-games-and-media)).


## FOSS@RIT:
    • Started out as a community of people with interest in free and open source software at RIT
    • Also had a purpose of keeping FOSSbox alive.
    • Existed in parallel with FOSS@MAGIC


## FOSS@MAGIC: 
    • "maybe 2018-2019"
    • Started out as just the Open Source minor
    • Existed in parallel with FOSS@RIT


## OPEN@RIT:
    • Sometime after Mid-year 2021
