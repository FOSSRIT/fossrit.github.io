LibreCorps is a FOSS@MAGIC Initiative connecting RIT students interested in open source to Humanitarian and Civic coding opportunities.
Specifically, opportunities for **Co-Operative Education Placements**, a.k.a. Co-Ops (full-time paid internships), that are part of graduation requirements.
For five years, students were successfully placed in positions with

* [UNICEF Innovation](http://unicefstories.org/2012/05/18/rits-partnership-with-the-kosovo-innovation-lab/)
* [Open APS](https://openaps.org/)
* [Night Scout](http://www.nightscout.info/)
* [Sugar Labs](https://sugarlabs.org/) and [OLPC](http://one.laptop.org/)
* And others

LibreCorps students work in two major areas on Co-Ops.
The first, not surprisingly, is technology.
The second is FOSS process and Community.
Many NGO and civic organizations put open-licensed work in repositories without a plan to build and maintain a community of contributors around their technology.
LibreCorps worked with UNICEF Innovation this past year to do just that and examples of that work can be found in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QqKe-Exa6BIqIlYtd_cVFJEtakXBCuLxSEqvrqQyToU) and [long-term roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F-pbO-8pHlf_DBolW4phMNXnwq9da54e5WftByT03SA) to do so.

LibreCorps is also interested in joint projects across international campuses.
