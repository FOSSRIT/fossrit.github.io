LibreCorps is a FOSS@MAGIC initiative connecting RIT students interested in open source to humanitarian and civic opportunities.
Specifically, opportunities for **Co-Operative Education Placements**, a.k.a. Co-Ops (full-time paid internships), that are part of graduation requirements.
LibreCorps has contracted with and/or successfully placed students both in technical and community positions with organizations like:

* [UNICEF Innovation](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/) and [Innovation Fund](https://unicefinnovationfund.org/ "UNICEF Innovation Fund")
* [Open APS](https://openaps.org/)
* [Night Scout](http://www.nightscout.info/)
* [Sugar Labs](https://sugarlabs.org/) and [OLPC](http://one.laptop.org/)
* And others

LibreCorps students work in two major areas on Co-Ops.
The first, not surprisingly, is technology.
The second is FOSS process and Community.
Many NGO and civic organizations put open-licensed work in repositories without a plan to build and maintain a community of contributors around their technology.
LibreCorps worked with UNICEF Innovation this past year to do just that and examples of that work can be found in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QqKe-Exa6BIqIlYtd_cVFJEtakXBCuLxSEqvrqQyToU) and [long-term roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F-pbO-8pHlf_DBolW4phMNXnwq9da54e5WftByT03SA) to do so.

Up until now, LibreCorps runs single instance by single instance.
Our three-year plan builds it into an on-going, student-driven, faculty-managed, standing FOSS consultancy program.
