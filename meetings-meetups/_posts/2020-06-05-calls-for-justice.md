RIT is hosting an online interfaith vigil titled “Calls for Justice at RIT” at 7 p.m. on Friday, June 5, in response to the killing of George Floyd and the subsequent demonstrations against the systemic racism and police brutality that continue to affect black and brown people across the U.S.

“The purpose of the event is to move the audience toward a feeling of connectedness, provide some level small level of comfort, and give them resources to cope with and respond to the situation,” said Monica Sanford, assistant director for spirituality and religious life and the event’s organizer.
“We acknowledge the situation that is affecting the members of our community so deeply.
We see them and hear them.”

The event will feature remarks from RIT students, faculty, staff and alumni.

* [Michael Laver][1], associate dean of the College of Liberal Arts
* [Brandon “BL” Ruiz-Williams][2], NTID Student Life team coordinator
