## What is Open@RIT?

Open@RIT is an effort initiated by [Professor Stephen Jacobs](https://www.rit.edu/directory/sxjics-stephen-jacobs), and supported by the Office of the Vice President of Research, to build support for an Open Source Programs Office at RIT.

To date, fifty faculty and staff across thirty-seven different units of RIT have asked to be added to the mailing list for the group.
Fifteen of those have been attending on-line meetings and/or contributing to the “[_Wish List for Activities_][1]”.


## How to get involved

1. Join the Mailing List.
   Send a request to be added to `sj` [at] `magic` [dot] `rit` [dot] `edu`.
2. Read, and if you’d like to, comment on and/or contribute to the “[_Activities_][1]” document.
3. Fill out [the form][2] we are using to populate a prototype directory of people and projects in the Open across campus.
   The intent of this action is to allow for greater collaboration across units and to begin to collect metrics on the University’s impact in and on all things Open.
4. Contribute to the “[_Knowledgebase_][3]” we’re crowd-sourcing for Open@RIT.

### How to contribute to [Knowledgebase][3]

You can do this in one of two ways:

1. **If you know how to use git/GitHub**:
   [Open a pull request][4].
1. **If you don’t know how to use them**:
   Add links to the “[_Activities_][1]” document.
   Someone will make comparisons between the two (for now) and move things over.
