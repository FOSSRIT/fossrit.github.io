## What is Open@RIT?

Open@RIT is the new Open Programs Office for the University directed by [Professor Stephen Jacobs](https://www.rit.edu/directory/sxjics-stephen-jacobs).  It's 
creation was approved by Provost Dr. Ellen Granberg at the end of June 2020 and placed under the Office of the Vice-President of Research, Dr. Ryne Raffaelle 
at the beginning of August.  

This page on the FOSS student GitHUb site has been created as a placeholder in the spirit of "release eary, release often."  An official website for Open@RIT has
been requested and is in the production que with the RIT web team.

## How to get involved with Open@RIT

1. Join the Mailing List.
   Send a request to be added to `sj` [at] `magic` [dot] `rit` [dot] `edu`.
2. Read, and if you’d like to, comment on and/or contribute to the “[_Activities_][1]” document.
3. Fill out [the form][2] we are using to populate a prototype directory of people and projects in the Open across campus.
   The intent of this action is to allow for greater collaboration across units and to begin to collect metrics on the University’s impact in and 
   on all things Open.
4. Contribute to the prototype “[_Knowledgebase_][3]” we’re crowd-sourcing for Open@RIT.

### How to contribute to [Knowledgebase][3]

You can do this in one of two ways:

1. **If you know how to use git/GitHub**:
   [Open a pull request][4].
1. **If you don’t know how to use them**:
   Add links to the “[_Activities_][1]” document.
   Someone will make comparisons between the two (for now) and move things over.
