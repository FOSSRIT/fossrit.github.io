Sky Time is an educational game that teaches young students how to tell time.

{% include content-blocks/gallery.html %}

The player can moves the hands on an analog clock and see the time they created on a digital clock.
A time is generated on the digital clock, and the student matches that time by changing the hands on the analog clock.
This game awards badges that can be viewed separately in the activity Sash.
The students can trade in suns (aka points) earned from correct answers to buy new clock faces and backgrounds.
