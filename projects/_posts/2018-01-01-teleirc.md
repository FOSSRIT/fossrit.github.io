## About

**Teleirc** bridges communication between a Telegram group and an IRC channel.
The project is a lightweight NodeJS application.

This bot was originally written for RITlug and our own
Telegram group and IRC channel. Today, it is used by various communities all over the world.

### Live demo

A public Telegram supergroup and IRC channel (on freenode) are available for you
to test. Our (small) development community is also found in these channels too.

* **[Telegram](https://t.me/teleirc)**
* **[IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ritlug-teleirc)** (#ritlug-teleirc @ irc.freenode.net)
